# Wedge slice smaller
# Different blur for things moving at different speeds
# reward scaled for looking at moving targets - ie multiply reward by 1 + (radial velocity / factor)
# speed layer


# chatting with prof:
# I want to be done in July
# How do I move this along so I can be done by then
# one month to write the paper
# can I cut the goal short?
# Ie just write about what I have so far?
# implement real world stuff and then train
# can I keep the implementing speed into the layers more simple - easier to implement possibly just as good
