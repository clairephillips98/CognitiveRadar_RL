# reward scaled for looking at moving targets - ie multiply reward by 1 + (radial velocity / factor)

# chatting with prof:
# I want to be done in July
# How do I move this along so I can be done by then
# one month to write the paper
# can I cut the goal short?
# Ie just write about what I have so far?
# implement real world stuff and then train
# can I keep the implementing speed into the layers more simple - easier to implement possibly just as good
# share stuff notes ravi
# add new baselines
# share bullet list of what i think i have left with ravi


# set n step to 1
# make episodes so much longer
# increase the weight for seeing a target
