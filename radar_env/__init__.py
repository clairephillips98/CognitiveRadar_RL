# Wedge slice smaller
# Different blur for things moving at different speeds
# reward scaled for looking at moving targets - ie multiply reward by 1 + (radial velocity / factor)
# speed layer


# chatting with prof:
# I want to be done in July
# How do I move this along so I can be done by then
# one month to write the paper
# can I cut the goal short?
# Ie just write about what I have so far?
# implement real world stuff and then train
# can I keep the implementing speed into the layers more simple - easier to implement possibly just as good
# share stuff notes ravi
# add new baselines
# share bullet list of what i think i have left with ravi


# set n step to 1
# make episodes so much longer
# increase the weight for seeing a target

# hole in literature
# what issue I am addressing
# explanation of what other people have done
# more into why's - 2 radar MARL
# we want to make it so there is more reward for viewing target with both radar
# dont need to over reference the paper - just say the work in 3
# more written about more cognative radar systems:  christian bell, sunila,
# say how im improving how previous work - rainbow dqn, why dqn?
