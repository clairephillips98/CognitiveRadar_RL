## Done
# take the BCE before blurring the next step, this way looking at the same area with no movement will leave to a reward of 0

# Done
# MAYBE IF REWARD IS 0 well set it to -1?
# penalize looking in the same direction with a reward of -1

# Done
# make the action be the angle at which is moved: action 1 means look over 1*x degree, action 2 means look over 2*x degrees


# look at correlation between doppler velocity and looks instead?

# what is revisit rate

# look at the penalized model for 1 radar

# are we seeing targets more often with the 2 radars?

# document everything for 1 radar case

# intro
# motivation
# talk about what other people are doing

# organization - chapter one explains da da da, chapter to is about la la la
# acronyms

# system model
# how its being modelled, approach, training, testing

# two radars

# results chapter
# why this model is the best
# different scenarios
# only show big differences

# conclusion
# these are the results, future work

# recuriion bought cyclica and valence
# whats teh work flow like
# how closely do the ML teams work with the science teams
# we both worked at banks as a data scientists
# would guess that recursion is really differnet than a bnak, what the biggest differences
# i saw that recrusion works closely with the Mila institute, how closely do you guys work?
# collaboration wiht othe firms like Phenomic? how do you guys differentiate?
# the website mentions wetlab where experiments are comducted to reinforce learning.
# Is this an automated process with RL driving experiements?
# You mentioned backing by Nvidia, and having a really huge super computer.
# I would imagine that your team is still concious about the compute you guys use.
# What does that look like, where are you trying to slim models or experiments down


# internship is 6-8 months
