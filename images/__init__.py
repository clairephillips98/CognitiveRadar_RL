## ALREADY DONE UNLESS SOMETHING MOVES
# take the BCE before blurring the next step, this way looking at the same area with no movement will leave to a reward of 0

# MAYBE IF REWARD IS 0 well set it to -1?
# penalize looking in the same direction with a reward of -1

#
# make the action be the angle at which is moved: action 1 means look over 1*x degree, action 2 means look over 2*x degrees
